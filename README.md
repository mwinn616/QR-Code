## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In order to style specific bodies of text, I created specific styles in my CSS and then assigned them to the HTML elements accordingly.

Here are some snippets of my code:

```html
<p class="text-center bold">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
<p class="text-center regular">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
```
```css
.bold {
    font-size: 22px;
    line-height: 120%;
    letter-spacing: 0px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: var(--slate-900);
}

.regular {
    font-size: 15px;
    line-height: 140%;
    letter-spacing: 0.2px;
    color: var(--slate-500);
}

.text-center {
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

There are a number of ways to accomplish a project once handed a design brief, but I'd like to learn the most optimal way to code. I'm thinking of future projects where I might iteratie and add to existing code -- I want to ensure I'm setting up the base of the project in a manner that allows for seamless iterations.
